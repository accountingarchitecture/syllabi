      <h2>Course Overview</h2>
      <p>This course explains how to become a <strong>professional</strong> <strong>accounting</strong> <strong>architect</strong>. Because you already know <strong>accounting</strong>, this course will focus on the other two components. The large <strong>architecture</strong> section of the course is an introduction to (1) the information life cycle, (2) information technology, and (3) IT controls from the perspective of an accountant, and the small <strong>professionalism</strong> section will address how to be a professional.</p>
      <p>This is not a course on accounting regulations. Financial accounting, audit, and tax fill those needs. This is not a course on calculating costs and revenues. That is for management accounting. This is also not a course on small business accounting software. All of those topics are relevant and valuable, but they are not the purpose of this course. This course will teach you about enterprise-grade information systems, information technology, and cyber-security. All accounting information comes from an information system, and as custodians of that information, it is the responsibility of accountants to understand how to interact with these systems.</p>
      <p>As a result, this course may feel more like a technology course than an accounting course. That is not by accident. Understanding how firms maintain their accounting data is not about memorizing the debits and credits of journal entries. It is about (1) knowing the steps to convert raw data into information, (2) understanding the necessary technologies, and (3) knowing how to preserve data integrity and information security.</p>
      <p>This is not an easy course. The topics we will discuss will be new to most students, and the deliverables will be difficult. Again, that is not by accident. In order to open your mind to the world of information systems, you will need to jump in and get your hands dirty. You should expect to spend between five and seven hours each week reading materials and completing assignments.</p>
      <p>You may ask why this course is structured this way. Many accounting courses rely on published textbooks and publisher-provided slide presentations and exams. It would be more convenient for me to follow this pattern, but I choose not to. Instead, I have spent countless hours creating my own lectures and assignments and curating reading materials. I have done this for two reasons. First, <em>your</em> future employers have demanded that you acquire skills in information technology and data analytics. Second, I want your skills in these areas to be better than anyone else's. You may not aspire to having IT skills, but this is the future of the accounting profession. Regardless of whether you like this course, I guarantee that this will not be one of those courses in which you will not learn anything. If you work, you <em>will</em> learn, and it will be worth it.</p>
      <p><b>Before you continue, you must read this syllabus <em>in its entirety</em>. Do not assume that the information in this syllabus does not apply to you. This syllabus represents a contract between you and me. Your participation in this course signifies that you have read and accepted every instruction and policy described in this syllabus.</b></p>

      <h3>Pre-requisites:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>ACCT 3110 - Intermediate Accounting I</li>
        <li>ACCT 3310 - Cost Accounting</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A solid understanding of both financial and managerial accounting are valuable for this course. In order to understand the usefulness of an information system, it is vital to understand an organization's informational needs, and many of those needs come from financial and managerial accounting. Other information and control needs come from the tax and audit functions, and although not required, having already taken a course in taxation and a course in auditing would also be valuable preparation for this course.</p>

      <h3 style="page-break-before: always">Required Materials:</h3>

      <h4>Course Portal</h4>
      <p>The course portal provides access to all learning materials for this course. I have written the course portal to be accessible via desktop, laptop, and mobile device. The materials on the course portal are grouped by topic. Topics usually span one week. Each topic will contain some or all of the following items:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Lecture</dt>
          <dd>The lectures are required reading and provide the foundation for each new topic. This course has no textbook. The decision to avoid using a textbook is primarily to save you money&mdash;you're welcome&mdash;but also because the issues we address constantly change, and a textbook would quickly be out-of-date. Instead, I have written a series of lectures that provide the foundational content for each topic. The lectures are in slide format. I have gone to great lengths to make these slides thorough and readable. The slides are not in PowerPoint format, but rather are specially designed Web pages, readily viewable on any device. In order to navigate the slide deck, use the arrow keys on a keyboard, swipe horizontally on a touchscreen, or click or tap the arrow heads on the sides of each slide. You may also print the slides, if you wish. After opening a lecture, append <span class="code">?print-pdf</span> to the end of the lecture URL, and reload the page. This will allow you to print one slide per page. Depending on your printer settings, you may also be able to print multiple slides per page.</dd>
        <dt>Article</dt>
          <dd>Although I have tried to write thorough lectures, I have also tried to keep the lectures concise. As a result, the lectures will never give exhaustive treatment to any topic. In order to supplement the content in these lectures, I have identified additional articles that either extend the principles from the lecture or give examples of real-world implementation. All articles are also required readings.</dd>
        <dt>Homework</dt>
          <dd>Although thorough knowledge of the material in the lectures and articles is important, that knowledge is not enough. The value of technology is in the ability to use it, and the only way to learn to use it is to practice. Furthermore, the role of accountants is to collaborate with and provide information to other business functions. Collaboration requires both IT knowledge and communication skills. Each week you will have one or more homework assignments or projects designed to provide experience with enterprise-grade IT tools or to reinforce your communication skills. The homework assignments will be listed under the name of the assignment.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>The Home page of the course portal will display all current and future topics so that you may work ahead, if you choose. The Archive page stores all previous topics.</p>
      <h4>eCourseware</h4>
      <p>Although the course materials will be on the course portal, Dropbox folders, quizzes, grades, and the final exam will be on eCourseware. The course portal displays a schedule of due dates for course deliverables.</p>
      <h4>Computer</h4>
      <p>All students must have access to a computer for this course. You may use a mobile device to read lectures and articles, but some assignments, including the exams, require functionality that is not available on a mobile device.</p>
      <h4>Codeanywhere</h4>
      <p>Many of the deliverables in this course require access to a Linux command line. If you do not yet know what that means, don't worry, you will. Codeanywhere provides Linux containers for $3.00 per month. As the first Linux deliverable approaches, I will explain how to sign-up for Codeanywhere, and I will provide a coupon code to receive 50% off of your monthly fee.</p>
      <p>This semester for the first time, I will allow students to use an alternative to Codeanywhere if they do not wish to pay the subscription fee. Windows Subsystem for Linux on Windows 10 and Linux (Beta) on Chrome OS both provide Linux containers. If time permits, I will demonstrate these alternative options in class, but if you choose to use one of these options, I will only help you to troubleshoot Linux commands, not the technology itself. In other words, you should consider these alternatives as &ldquo;unsupported.&rdquo;</p>
      <div id="proctoru">
      <h4>ProctorU</h4>
      <p>All online exams in the School of Accountancy are video proctored. For this course, ProctorU will provide video proctoring for the exams. ProctorU is an online proctoring service that allows you to take your exam from home. You will be responsible for signing up with ProctorU and for paying the fee to take each exam. You will need to schedule your proctoring session at least 72 hours in advance to avoid any on demand scheduling fees. In order to create a ProctorU account, if you do not already have one, visit <a href="https://go.proctoru.com/registrations" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Website opens in new window">https://go.proctoru.com/registrations</a> and select the &ldquo;Test-Taker&rdquo; option.</p>
      <p>Please review the <a href="https://www.proctoru.com/live-plus-resource-center" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Website opens in new window">Student Resource Page</a> to prepare yourself and your workspace for your exam session. ProctorU encourages students to log in to their accounts and test their equipment at least one hour prior to their scheduled sessions. Simply click on &ldquo;Test your Equipment&rdquo; to make sure your computer and network connection are optimal for exam proctoring. In order to use ProctorU you will need to have a computer running Windows or macOS, a high-speed Internet connection, a webcam (internal or external), and a government-issued photo ID. Please note Chromebooks are not compatible. In order to prevent connectivity issues, please ensure that your Internet connection is not being used for gaming or streaming movies or music during your exam. If you have any issues, please contact a ProctorU live technician.</p>

      <h3>Explanation and Schedule of Deliverables:</h3>
      <p>Please note, multiple deliverables have required file formats (e.g., PDF) for submission. The decision to submit a file that differs from the required format may result in a grade penalty.</p>
      <h4>Quizzes</h4>
      <p>In order to encourage careful reading throughout the semester, a quiz will accompany each topic. Quizzes will be multiple choice and true-false and will cover both lectures and articles. The course portal reports the due date and time for each quiz. All quizzes will be on eCourseware. <em>I will not reopen any quizzes, and I will not offer any makeup quizzes for any reason.</em> I encourage you to take all quizzes on time to prepare for the exams because the lecture material will be tested on the exams. I do not give quiz feedback. If you wish to discuss a quiz, you may visit me during my office hours. You will have two attempts for each quiz. Each quiz attempt will include different, randomly-selected questions. Your quiz grade will be the higher of the two attempts.</p>
      <h4>Homework</h4>
      <p>Practical experience is more valuable than simply reading lectures. I assign multiple homework assignments throughout the semester to give you the opportunity to practice what you have learned. The course portal reports all homework due dates, and the homework assignment instructions explain how to complete and submit the homework. I will not grade any homework assignment that fails to satisfy the assignment instructions. I will not grade any late assignments, but I encourage you to complete all homework assignments in order to prepare for the exams because the skills practiced in the homework will be tested on the exams. I do not give homework solutions. If you wish to discuss an assignment, you may visit me during my office hours.</p>
      <div id="research">
      <h4>Research</h4>
      <p>Course materials and quizzes center around content that I have curated, but I also wish to encourage independent reading, thinking, and learning. Each student will complete two deliverables to demonstrate independent research:</p>
      <dl>
        <div id="ai-report">
        <dt>AI Report</dt>
        <dd>Each student will write one AI report. The report must answer the following question, "How will AI affect the future of the accounting profession?" The report should be at least 1,000 words in length and draw on materials beyond the lecture slides and readings that I provide. The report should not be a discussion of your opinion; it should rely on externally valid references (a minimum of 5). I will not dictate which citation format, but I require that each report use a citation format for all references. Each report should have a cover page and page numbers (no page number on the cover page). I will grade reports on content (accuracy and thoroughness), grammar and spelling, and formatting and presentation. Remember, this should look like a professional report. The <a href="http://www.memphis.edu/cwc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Website opens in new window">Center for Writing and Communication</a> (CWC) can provide you with one-on-one consultations to help you to improve your writing skills. I will give extra credit for scheduling and completing a CWC consultation to get help with preparing or revising your report. You must send me a copy of your session report in order to receive extra credit. You should submit your report in PDF format to Dropbox by the due date reported on the course portal. After I have graded your AI report, you may revise and resubmit it to earn a higher grade, but it will be your sole responsibility to identify errors and weaknesses and correct them.</dd>
        </div>
        <dt>Presentation</dt>
        <dd>Each student will give one individual presentation to the class during the semester. Each presentation should be approximately 20 minutes long on a topic of your choosing that relates to a current technology issue. The topic should not be a reiteration of something already covered in a lecture or an article, but rather it should introduce a new concept or issue. I will first ask for volunteers for each presentation day, and if any time slots remain, I will assign presenters at random. Students may choose the form of their presentations (e.g., slide deck, hands-on tutorial, video, in-class exercise, etc). Presentations will be graded according to <a href="https://accountingarchitecture.github.io/supplement/presentations/presentation-rubric.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Website opens in new window">this rubric</a>. If you miss or are unprepared on your presentation day for any reason, you should not expect to be able to present on a later date or to makeup your presentation. I will give extra credit toward your presentation grade if you schedule and attend a CWC consultation to get help with preparing or practicing your presentation. You must send me a copy of your session report in order to receive extra credit.</dd>
      </dl>
      </div>
      <h4>Exams</h4>
      <p>This course has two midterms and one final exam. The exams will draw from the lectures and the homework assignments. Exam I will cover the first third of the course, and exam II will cover the second third of the course. The final exam will cover the final third of the course. The course portal reports when the exams are available. You must use ProctorU to video proctor your exam. Any exam that is not proctored will receive a 0.</p>

      <h2>Course Policies</h2>
      <div id="email">
      <h3>Email:</h3>
      <p>Email to my University of Memphis email address is how you may communicate with me. You should not, under any circumstances, use eCourseware's email function. I will communicate using email, as well, and I will always try to respond to email within 24 hours. However, I will not respond to emails on weekends. Instead, I will answer emails sent on Friday evening, Saturday, or Sunday on Monday.</p>
      <p>The School of Accountancy has a uniform email policy for all student communication with faculty. You must always follow these guidelines when drafting any email:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Use a proper salutation. Do not use &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; &ldquo;Good afternoon,&rdquo; &ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; or other informal salutations. Addressing the recipient by name (if known) is preferred. Type the recipient's title (&ldquo;Dr.&rdquo;, &ldquo;Mr.&rdquo;, &ldquo;Mrs.&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ms.&rdquo; etc.) and the recipient's last name, followed by a comma, colon, or hyphen. You should never use the recipient's first name unless you have express permission to do so. If you are uncertain which title to use, it is safe to use the title in the recipient's signature block if the recipient has previously emailed you. For professors, use the titles &ldquo;Dr.&rdquo; or &ldquo;Professor&rdquo; followed by the recipient's last name. If you do not know the name of the person you are writing to, use the salutation &ldquo;Dear Sir or Madam:&rdquo; or &ldquo;To whom it may concern:&rdquo;.</li>
        <li>Introduce yourself in the first paragraph. Explain who you are and why you are writing. When writing to a professor, also explain which class and section you are in. This introduction should be in the first sentence or two of your email. The following is a list of inappropriate reasons for writing an email to me:
          <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
            <li>You should not email me about an assignment on the day that an assignment is due. I will not respond to these emails because it encourages procrastination.</li>
            <li>You should not email me asking that a deadline be changed, nor should you email me to ask whether you can make up an assignment. The syllabus explains which assignments you can make up and which assignments you cannot make up. I will not change this policy, even for unexpected events. All course deliverables are available well before their deadlines so no unexpected event should prevent you from completing them.</li>
            <li>You should not email me about your grade. Using your gradebook on eCourseware and the syllabus explanation of deliverables, you can determine your own standing in the course. You should not email me at the end of the semester asking for a higher grade or for special extra credit to raise your grade. I will not raise grades for any reason. You can earn a higher grade by working more diligently during the semester.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Use formal language. Use complete sentences and polite phrasing. Never write emails as you would write text messages. Avoid slang, contractions, emoticons and emojis, profanity, jokes, accusations, and rude or offensive language.</li>
        <li>Use a proper form of closing. Examples of potential closings include: &ldquo;Sincerely,&rdquo; &ldquo;Respectfully,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Your student,&rdquo; (if emailing a professor) followed by your full name and job title or other signature (if you have one).</li>
        <li>Proofread your message for content, spelling, and grammar. Do not rely on your email service's spelling or grammar checker. Reading your email aloud or asking someone to proofread it is a great way to catch any typos, mistakes, or unclear phrases.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>If you fail to follow these rules when emailing me, I will return your email with directions to rewrite it. For additional information regarding proper email etiquette, please review the <a href="https://www.memphis.edu/fcbe/students/netiquette.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Website opens in new window">Fogelman College Netiquette Guide</a>.</p>

      <div id="integrity">
      <h3>Academic Integrity:</h3>
      <p>The School of Accountancy has zero tolerance for academic dishonesty. The School of Accountancy has a uniform academic integrity policy for all students taking accounting classes. All of the following constitute academic dishonesty and will result in a 0 on any affected deliverables and, at the instructor's sole discretion, a failing grade for the course. Failure to report any of these actions also constitutes academic dishonesty and can result in the same penalty:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Using an <em>unapproved</em> resource to complete a graded deliverable, including but not limited to, Course Hero, Chegg, or Quizlet. Approved resources are limited to the textbook and other instructor-provided materials.</li>
        <li>Using an <em>approved</em> resource to complete a graded deliverable without express permission from the instructor. &ldquo;Open-book&rdquo; authorizes the use of the textbook, and no other resource. &ldquo;Open-note&rdquo; authorizes the use of a student's own notes, and no other resource. &ldquo;Open-note&rdquo; does not authorize the use of prior deliverables (e.g., quizzes, exams, or homework) or feedback from prior deliverables without express permission from the instructor.</li>
        <li>Sharing any questions or answers on a graded deliverable with another individual.</li>
        <li>Requesting or receiving any questions or answers on a graded deliverable from another individual.</li>
        <li>Discussing any aspect of a graded deliverable with another individual without express permission from the instructor.</li>
        <li>Posting any questions or answers from a deliverable or any content from a textbook, textbook slides, or other publisher or instructor materials to an online resource, including but not limited to, Course Hero, Chegg, or Quizlet, or sharing these with another individual. (NB: This also constitutes illegal copyright infringement.)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Students should act with utmost integrity at all times and use sound judgment when engaging in any practices not expressly prohibited. For additional information regarding student conduct, please review the Fogelman College <a href="http://www.memphis.edu/fcbe/students/integrity.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Website opens in new window">Standards for Academic Integrity</a>.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="late">
      <h3>Late Assignments:</h3>
      <p>I will not accept any late submissions of any deliverables, except for the AI report with an appropriate grade penalty. I will not offer any makeup quizzes or exams.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Attendance:</h3>
      <p>For University of Memphis attendance policies including guidelines for adding or dropping classes, please reference the Undergraduate Catalog's document on <a href="http://catalog.memphis.edu/content.php?catoid=3&navoid=70&hl=attendance&returnto=search#class-attendance" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Website opens in new window">Class Attendance</a>. Your participation grade depends on your attending every class and actively participating.</p>

      <h3>Extra Credit:</h3>
      <p>I currently have no plans to offer extra credit other than for CWC consultations as explained in the syllabus. If I decide to offer additional extra credit, I will communicate that to the entire class. You should not email me asking for extra credit.</p>
