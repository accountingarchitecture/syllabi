      <h2>Course Overview</h2>
      <p>Welcome to an introduction of financial statement analysis. Financial statement analysis is the process of analyzing information in historical financial statements to assess a company's current and future performance. Valuation is a subset of financial statement analysis used to assess a company's net worth. Much of the content of this course will be a review of your prior financial accounting courses, and the remainder will demonstrate how to use your accounting knowledge to predict how a company will fare in the future.</p>
      <p>This is an online course. I have identified and selected reading materials, exercises, and exams that cover the most important topics for this course. It is your responsibility to read <em>all</em> of the assigned materials and complete <em>all</em> of the deliverables in order to learn and understand the concepts. As is common to online courses, effective learning will require diligence and motivation. If you complete all deliverables diligently, you will almost certainly earn a high grade.</p>
      <p>Also, this is an accelerated, eight-week course. As a result, we will only be able to cover some of the topics included in the course textbook, and of the topics that we do cover, we will not be able to achieve as much depth as we would in a full semester. I invite you to consider extending your learning beyond what we cover in this course by reading the remaining, unassigned textbook chapters on your own time and also by applying the principles taught to your own data analysis of financial statements.</p>
      <p>Finally, you should know that this is my first time teaching this course, or any graduate course, for that matter. I will make mistakes, and I invite you to work with me so that we can make this a successful experience together.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Explanation and Schedule of Deliverables:</h3>
      <h4>Reading and Videos</h4>
      <p>The first task each week is to read the required chapter. You will not receive any points for reading, but it is necessary. You should not assume that you can skip the reading and use the homework assignments to learn the principles. You may read the print textbook or the ebook on myBusinessCourse. Additionally, myBusinessCourse provides a set of explanatory videos for each chapter that review the learning objectives and review problems. These will be especially helpful for those of you who prefer face-to-face lectures over online, self-driven learning.</p>
      <h4>Homework</h4>
      <p>Each chapter also has a homework assignment. Each homework assignment is worth 5 points and has unlimited attempts. All homework assignments are open-book. See <a href="#integrity">below</a> for the correct meaning of &ldquo;open-book&rdquo; according to the rules of academic integrity. Homework is the best preparation for the exams. myBusinessCourse reports the due dates for each homework assignment. <strong>(NB: Some weeks have more than one chapter and homework assignment.)</strong></p>
      <h4>Exams</h4>
      <p>This course will have three exams: two midterms and one final. The exams will follow the same format as the homework assignments. Exam I will cover the first three chapters in the course, exam II will cover chapters 5 through 8, and the final exam will cover chapters 11 through 13. myBusinessCourse reports all exam dates. The final exam will be <strong>August 7</strong> according to the <a href="https://www.memphis.edu/registrar/calendars/exams/20u-final-exams.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Website opens in new window">Registrar's calendar</a>. You must use ProctorU to video proctor your exam. Any exam that is not proctored will receive a 0.</p>

      <h2>Course Policies</h2>
      <div id="email">
      <h3>Email:</h3>
      <p>Email to my University of Memphis email address is how you may communicate with me. You should not, under any circumstances, use eCourseware's email function. I will communicate using email, as well, and I will always try to respond to email within 24 hours. However, I will not respond to emails on weekends. Instead, I will answer emails sent on Friday evening, Saturday, or Sunday on Monday.</p>
      <p>You must always follow these guidelines when drafting an email:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Use a proper salutation. Do not use &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; &ldquo;Good afternoon,&rdquo; &ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; or other informal salutations. Addressing the recipient by name (if known) is preferred. Type the recipient's title (&ldquo;Dr.&rdquo;, &ldquo;Mr.&rdquo;, &ldquo;Mrs.&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ms.&rdquo; etc.) and the recipient's last name, followed by a comma, colon, or hyphen. You should never use the recipient's first name unless you have express permission to do so. If you are uncertain which title to use, it is safe to use the title in the recipient's signature block if the recipient has previously emailed you. For professors, use the titles &ldquo;Dr.&rdquo; or &ldquo;Professor&rdquo; followed by the recipient's last name. If you do not know the name of the person you are writing to, use the salutation &ldquo;Dear Sir or Madam:&rdquo; or &ldquo;To whom it may concern:&rdquo;.</li>
        <li>Introduce yourself in the first paragraph. Explain who you are and why you are writing. When writing to a professor, also explain which class and section you are in. This introduction should be in the first sentence or two of your email. The following is a list of inappropriate reasons for writing an email to me:
          <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
            <li>You should not email me about an assignment on the day that an assignment is due. I will not respond to these emails because it encourages procrastination.</li>
            <li>You should not email me asking that a deadline be changed, nor should you email me to ask whether you can make up an assignment. The syllabus explains which assignments you can make up and which assignments you cannot make up. I will not change this policy, even for unexpected events. All course deliverables are available well before their deadlines so no unexpected event should prevent you from completing them.</li>
            <li>You should not email me about your grade. Using your gradebook on eCourseware and the syllabus explanation of deliverables, you can determine your own standing in the course. You should not email me at the end of the semester asking for a higher grade or for special extra credit to raise your grade. I will not raise grades for any reason. You can earn a higher grade by working more diligently during the semester.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Use formal language. Use complete sentences and polite phrasing. Never write emails as you would write text messages. Avoid slang, contractions, emoticons and emojis, profanity, jokes, accusations, and rude or offensive language.</li>
        <li>Use a proper form of closing. Examples of potential closings include: &ldquo;Sincerely,&rdquo; &ldquo;Respectfully,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Your student,&rdquo; (if emailing a professor) followed by your full name and job title or other signature (if you have one).</li>
        <li>Proofread your message for content, spelling, and grammar. Do not rely on your email service's spelling or grammar checker. Reading your email aloud or asking someone to proofread it is a great way to catch any typos, mistakes, or unclear phrases.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>If you fail to follow these rules when emailing me, I will return your email with directions to rewrite it. For additional information regarding proper email etiquette, please review the <a href="https://www.memphis.edu/fcbe/students/netiquette.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Website opens in new window">Fogelman College Netiquette Guide</a>.</p>

      <div id="integrity">
      <h3>Academic Integrity:</h3>
      <p>The School of Accountancy has zero tolerance for academic dishonesty. All of the following constitute academic dishonesty and will result in a 0 on any affected deliverables and, at the instructor's sole discretion, a failing grade for the course. Failure to report any of these actions also constitutes academic dishonesty and can result in the same penalty:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Using an <em>unapproved</em> resource to complete a graded deliverable, including but not limited to, Course Hero or Chegg. Approved resources are limited to the textbook and other instructor-provided materials.</li>
        <li>Using an <em>approved</em> resource to complete a graded deliverable without express permission from the instructor. &ldquo;Open-book&rdquo; authorizes the use of the textbook, and no other resource. &ldquo;Open-note&rdquo; authorizes the use of a student's own notes, and no other resource. &ldquo;Open-note&rdquo; does not authorize the use of prior deliverables (e.g., quizzes, exams, or homework) or feedback from prior deliverables without express permission from the instructor.</li>
        <li>Sharing any questions or answers on a graded deliverable with another individual.</li>
        <li>Requesting or receiving any questions or answers on a graded deliverable from another individual.</li>
        <li>Discussing any aspect of a graded deliverable with another individual without express permission from the instructor.</li>
        <li>Posting any questions or answers from a deliverable or any content from a textbook, textbook slides, or other publisher or instructor materials to an online resource, including but not limited to, Course Hero or Chegg, or sharing these with another individual. (NB: This also constitutes illegal copyright infringement.)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Students should act with utmost integrity at all times and use sound judgment when engaging in any practices that are not expressly prohibited. For additional information regarding student conduct, please review the Fogelman College <a href="http://www.memphis.edu/fcbe/students/integrity.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Website opens in new window">Standards for Academic Integrity</a>.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Late Assignments:</h3>
      <p>I currently have no plans to accept late assignments or to allow makeups.</p>

      <h3>Extra Credit:</h3>
      <p>I currently have no plans to offer extra credit for this course. If I change my mind, I will announce the opportunity to the entire class. Students should not contact me to ask for opportunities to earn extra credit.</p>
